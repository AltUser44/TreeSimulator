This application is a Forest Fire Simulation written in Java that visually demonstrates
the dynamics of fire spread in a forest environment. This is done Through a grid-based representation,
users can observe how fire propagates from tree to tree, simulating a real-world forest fire scenario.
The application allows for user interaction, where clicking on a tree cell ignites a fire,
providing an intuitive and educational experience on the behavior of forest fires.
